# todoapp2

This was created and deployed as part of my backend engineering learning.

I learnt how to use ejs and javascript to create dynamic pages.

I was able to learn how to use a database both locally and remotely using MongoDB.

I was able to deploy the project on heroku.

It was fun but tasking doing this project.

You can take a look at the initial to-do project to follow my progress.

thanks
